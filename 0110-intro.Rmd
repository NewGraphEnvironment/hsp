# Safety Policy

At New Graph Environment we believe that all injuries are preventable
and that safety is the responsibility of everyone. We believe that
getting hurt at work is not acceptable and that by building a culture of
safety we:

-   will look ahead to identify hazards,

-   will document safety procedures and ensure that our management,
    staff and contractors are familiar with them and understand why we
    have them,

-   will strive for continuous improvement to ensure that we learn from
    the past and look to the future to facilitate the safest working
    environment possible for ourselves, our contractors, our clients and
    the public.

```                        

## Safety Team Members

As a small company all management and staff are considered safety team
members and expected to integral to the safety program. Feedback is
encouraged as continual improvement is a paramount goal.

## Roles, rights and responsibilities

Everyone has a role to play in workplace safety. Whether you are the owner, employer, supervisor, worker, or prime contractor. Know your rights and responsibilities. These are outlined on the WorkSafeBC website [here](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/rights-responsibilities).


### Right to refuse work and report unsafe conditions {#right-to-refuse-work-and-report-unsafe-conditions .Style1}

You have the right to refuse unsafe work if you have reasonable cause to believe the work you are doing could create a hazard or cause an injury. Identify hazards before starting work and determine whether it is safe to proceed.
This is work and it is not worth it to risk life and limb.


## Workplace Harassment

We are committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and harassment-free workplace. Workplace harassment is a serious issue that must be proactively addressed to ensure a positive work environment for all employees. While we do not currently have a formal harassment policy, we follow the guidelines set by WorkSafeBC to prevent and address workplace harassment. More information can be found here: [WorkSafeBC Bullying & Harassment](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/hazards-exposures/bullying-harassment?_cldee=diBsSzBWSFKXXBbk30LCVQiXprPgifNxAwZ1vx3j7jYb_IQzIpscZs-Dvc-MWyR9&recipientid=lead-de0808e7d6beee119078002248b17fec-dc97903950934bb9b268a3f2d72746c8&esid=efb76100-9b60-ef11-bfe4-0022483bf52c).  

### Reporting & Investigations  
- Employees are encouraged to document and report incidents to their supervisor or designated safety representative. Our workplace harassment  report template can be found here: [Workplace Harassment Report Template](#haras_report)
- We take all reports seriously and commit to investigating them promptly, ensuring fairness and impartiality. If necessary, a third-party investigator may be engaged to maintain objectivity.  

### Protection & Support  
- Retaliation against employees who report harassment or participate in an investigation will not be tolerated.  
- Support services, such as medical and counseling assistance, are available to affected employees.  

We understand that some employees may feel uncomfortable reporting harassment internally. In such cases, they may seek assistance from WorkSafeBC, the BC Human Rights Tribunal, or legal counsel. By fostering a culture of respect and accountability, we ensure a safer and more inclusive workplace for everyone.  


## COVID 19 Prevention and Risks

We have developed a COVID-19 Safety Plan that outlines the policies,
guidelines, and procedures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

All staff, contractors, volunteers, and participants must complete a
self-assessment (<https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en>) before starting
work each day. If they are experiencing any symptoms related to COVID-19
they must halt all involvement or participation, notify the project
supervisor, and get officially tested.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads in several ways, including
through droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or from touching a
contaminated surface before touching the face. Planning to COVID-19 is a
moving target and should be a continuous effort. Planning is outlined by
WCB
(<https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operation>).
Detailed procedures are included in the safe work procedures in the
Appendices of this document and were developed by progressing through
the following steps:

1.  Assess the risk at your workplace to identify places where the risk
    of transmission is introduced

    a.  What job tasks or processes require workers to come into close
        proximity with one another or members of the public?

    b.  What tools, machinery, and equipment do people come into contact
        with in the course of their work?

    c.  What surfaces are touched often, such as doorknobs, light
        switches, equipment, and shared tools?

2.  Implement measures to reduce the risk

    a.  Maintain a distance of 2 metres (6 feet) between workers and
        others wherever possible

    b.  Create pods of workers who work together exclusively to minimize
        the risk of broad transmission throughout the workplace

    c.  Where physical distance cannot be maintained consider the use of
        masks.

    d.  Provide adequate hand-washing facilities on site for all workers

    e.  Develop policies around when workers must wash their hands,
        including upon arriving for work, before and after breaks and
        before and after handling common tools and equipment.

    f.  Implement a cleaning protocol for all common areas and surfaces,
        including washrooms, equipment, tools, common tables, desks,
        light switches, and door handles. Ensure those engaged in
        cleaning have adequate training and materials.

    g.  Remove any unnecessary tools or equipment that may elevate the
        risk of transmission.

3.  Develop policies to manage the workplace

    a.  Anyone who has had [symptoms of
        COVID-19](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/symptoms)
        in the last 10 days must self-isolate at home.

    b.  Anyone under the direction of the provincial health officer to
        self-isolate must follow those instructions

    c.  When workers or contractors are feeling ill at work they should
        immediately let their supervisor know and go home. If symptoms
        align with those of COVID-19 they should be tested and
        self-isolate until they are symptom free and have a negative
        test result.

## Required safety meetings

### New Worker Orientations {#new-worker-orientations .Style1}

New workers are at a high risk for injuries. They need to know the
safety policies and procedures and demonstrate that they understand how
to protect themselves and others. All employees and dependent
contractors operating under your company's safety plan must review the
New Graph health and safety policies and safe work procedures on their
first day before they start work or when returning to work after an
absence of longer than 6 weeks. Template to be filled out is attached as [Appendix 1](#new-worker).

### Tailboards {#tailboards-site-and-worker-assessment-equipment-and-vehicle-inspection-emergency-contact-list .Style1}

Tailboard meetings are a way to reset at the start of new work tasks to
put safety first as the top priority at all places of work. Our
tailboard template is unique in that it contains documentation of numerous safety policy actions in one place. Tailboards
include references to field safety plans and contain:

-   Site Assessments, Hazard Identifications and Risk Assessments
-   Worker Assessments
-   Personal Protective Equipment Checklist/Inspections
* Machinery Inspection (Vehicle/Trailer/ATV)
-   Emergency Contact List and Info
* Call In/Call Out Numbers for Check-ins
-   Hazard Inspections
-   First Aid Assessments

They are included in this plan as [Appendix 2](#tailboard).

### Monthly Safety Meetings

We are a [Safe Certified](https://www.bcforestsafe.org/) company and with that comes the requirement to have monthly safety meetings.  These meetings are a way to discuss safety issues and to ensure that everyone is on the same page. They are also a way to document that we are meeting our safety obligations. You can find our past safety meetings at `oneDrive/Projects/safety/meetings`. 

## First Aid equipment and procedures

A level 1 kit is kept under the seat of each work vehicle and our OHSP
is also kept in the truck. The kit should be inspected for contents to
see that it is complete. A weatherproof container is recommended for all items except the blankets. Below is an itemized list of what should be in
the kit:

### Worksite First Aid Requirements {#worksite-first-aid-requirements .Style1}

To determine an adequate and appropriate level of first aid coverage,
the first step is a first aid assessment. This requires a full review of the workplace. The
assessment will help you determine the minimum level of first aid needed
in your workplace. First aid levels are outlined in the [OHS Regulation
Schedule 3-A: Minimum Levels of First
Aid](https://www.worksafebc.com/en/law-policy/occupational-health-safety/searchable-ohs-regulation/ohs-regulation/part-03-rights-and-responsibilities#Schedule3A). First aid requirements are found in [Appendix 5](#firstaid).

Below are the steps for a first aid assessment.

-   Identify the number of workplaces.

-   Identify your workplace hazard rating.

-   Consider the surface travel time to a hospital.

-   Determine the number of workers on a shift.

-   Determine the required first aid services for your workplace.

-   Review your assessment.
