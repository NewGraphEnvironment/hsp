# Plans and Assessments

## Field Safety Plans {#field-safety-plans .Style1}

Field safety plans are a critical component of our work. They are a way to ensure that we are prepared for the unexpected and that we have a plan in place to keep our team safe. The field safety plan should be specific to each project and should be kept easily accessible to all team members. An example can be found [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/safety_plan_skeena_2023/). Information included in these plans include:

  1. Location and contact info of accommodations where employees are staying so that the designated safety person can reach them in case of an emergency or required check-in.
  
  2. Description of personal and company vehicles including make, model, year, and licence plate number.
  
  3. Crew member contact details, including emergency contacts.
  
  4. Personal and crew equipment checklist. A list of all required safety equipment can be found [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/new_graphiti/blob/main/assets/data/equipment.csv). 
     
     Personal safety equipment is important especially because we are often working alone. Ensuring you have **charged** communication       devices as well as spare batteries or chargers is critical for maintaining communication with the team. Personal safety equipment       can be found in Table \@ref(tab:personal-eq). 
     
     It's also important to have the right safety equipment in the truck in case of vehicle issues, road conditions, or accidents. Truck      safety equipment can be found in Table \@ref(tab:truck-eq).
    
  5. Location and contact info of nearest hospital.
  
  6. Check in and failed check in procedures.
  
  7. A brief description of the job, as well as map links and a list of possible locations where crew members will visit.

### Check-in Procedures and Field Communications

Call, text or in reach emergency contact each morning to share the plan
for the day (i.e. name of roads and sites). Agree on a regular daily
check in time and report position/provide updates.

### Procedures for Failed Check-In

If phone call or in reach check-in is not received by agreed upon time,
send text to in reach units, call or text cell phones of field crew
members. If no response please call accommodations, then personal
emergency contacts to see if they have heard anything. Wait 1 hour and
text in reach, text or call cell phones and personal emergency contacts
and accommodations again. Repeat after 2 hours - if no response then
notify the RCMP of a missing persons in field.

## Close-calls / incident reporting requirements and procedures {#hazard-close-call-incident-reporting-requirements-and-procedures .Style1}

Incidents are situations in the workplace that resulted in or could have resulted in injuries, illnesses, or fatalities. Close calls are incidents that almost happened. These can be used to prevent incidents in the future. We have policies in place so that we can document and review close calls. Reviewing close calls and incidents can help us identify hazards earlier so that we can catch them before they happen. This review process can help us improve our safety procedures such as updating our tailboards. Reporting templates are attached as [Appendix 3](#incident). A summary of how to fill out an incident/close call report is seen below:

* Record the date of the incident and the names of all personnel involved
* Give a detailed description of the events that transpired leading up to and including the incident. What happened and how did it happen? Was first aid required? 
* Describe the immediate and root cause of the incident. Were safety procedures not followed? Were the presence of hazards not communicated properly beforehand? Was the employee/contractor involved in the incident not wearing the proper safety equipment?
* Describe the corrective action(s) to be undertaken. This can depend on the situation. Do your best to ensure that an incident like this will never happen again. Update safety procedures, ensure everyone is wearing the proper safety equipment, communicate to people new to the job that you have the right to refuse unsafe work, etc. 
* Sign and date the incident/close call report.

Examples of past incident/close calls include:

* Contractor slipping and falling into a deep beaver pond, the person was wearing waders but no wading belt. No serious injury occured.
* While backing up on the highway, an employee drove too close to the ditch and almost flipped over. This was a close call.
* While tagging fish with a needle and pit tags, an employee stabbed their finger with the needle. There was some bleeding but first aid was administered right away. 

## Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and Procedures {#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures .Style1}

Our Emergency Response Plan can be located and downloaded here: [Emergency Response Plan](#ERP). 


### Remote Site Emergency Call-In Procedures

Remote Site Emergency Call-In Procedures:

-   Dial RCMP
-   Name:
-   Location: (GPS, UTM Co-ordinates, Road Km)
-   Phone \#
-   Nature Of Injury: (severity, what happened, and \# of Victims)
-   Environmental Conditions: (weather, slope, access conditions)
-   Request what you are going to need: (SAR, PEP, Helicopter,)

### Fire Safety

Wildfires are becoming increasingly common in British Columbia. It's important to know how to prevent wildfires and to have a plan in place in case a fire breaks out.

Before heading out to the field:

  - Review the current [fire danger rating](https://wfapps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/pub/wfwx-danger-summary-war/dangerSummary) for the area.
  - Review the [BC Wildfire Dashboard](https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/dashboard) to be aware of any current wildfires in the area. If there are active wildfires in the area, discuss as a group if it is safe to proceed with fieldwork.
  - Review the [Wildfire Response Plan](#wildfire-response-plan) below.
  - Review and complete the Emergency Response Plan which can be found in [Appendix 6](#ERP). Ensure all crew members are familiar with the plan and their roles.

While in the field:

  - Regularly monitor the [fire danger rating](https://wfapps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/pub/wfwx-danger-summary-war/dangerSummary) using representative weather stations as well as the [BC Wildfire Dashboard](https://wildfiresituation.nrs.gov.bc.ca/dashboard). 
  - Never use open flames or create sparks as part of field tasks when the fire danger rating is “high”
  or “extreme” in the fieldwork or surrounding area.
  - Keep vehicles on roads or other non-vegetated areas to prevent ignition of wildfires by catalytic
  converters.

#### Wildfire Response Plan

  1. Stop operations.
  2. Crew lead notifies all crew members and crews regroup if separated.
  3. Crew members assume roles as per the Emergency Response Plan.
  4. Call Forest Fire Reporting: 1-800-663-5555 or \* 5555 on the Cantel and Telus networks
  5. __Small fire__, can be suppressed by crews:
      - Crews suppress fire to their level of safety and competence (water, fire extinguishers, or hand tools). Never attempt to suppress an uncontrolled wildfire. 
      - The crew member in charge of fire suppression operations should continue to supervise the efforts until relieved by licensee/contractor representative or BC Wildfire Management Branch personnel.
      - If crews suppress fire for x amount of time and the fire has not been suppressed then the crew lead should activate the emergency evacuation plan as per the tailboard. 
  6. __Large fire__, must evacuate:
      - Crew members follow Emergency Response Plan and evacuate using the discussed evacuation route.
      - Crew lead accounts for all crew members before evacuating the site.
      - Crews meet at assembly location.    

### Landslide, Avalanche, and Natural Disaster Response

-   Ensure all workers are trained and understand response procedures and
    this emergency response plan is available on site at all times.
-   Notify supervisor and other workers. If safe to do so, assess
    situation to determine if activities must be shutdown.
-   Take steps to control further environmental impacts.
-   Supervisors must account for all workers before leaving the site. If
    a shutdown is required, park all equipment in an environmentally
    safe location (avoid riparian management areas, steep side slopes,
    steep road sections, areas with excessive soil moisture, and areas
    within reach of standing timber).
-   Contact appropriate parties if significant environmental damage or
    damage to infrastructure requiring repair has occurred (MFLNRO,
    BCTS, MoTI, etc.).

### Spill Response

**Step 1. Ensure Safety**

-   Assess site hazards to ensure safe work procedures.
-   Notify Site Supervisor and Environmental Monitor (EM).
-   If unsure of the product, consult the MSDS sheets.
-   Eliminate ignition sources if spilled material is flammable.
-   Wear proper personal protective equipment (gloves) contained in the
    spill kit.

**Step 2. Contain the spill**

-   Eliminate the source of the spill.
-   Use contents of the provided spill kit(s) to stop the spread of the
    spill/leak. Absorbent socks can be used to surround the spill.
-   **Remember: White = Fuels & Oils Only, Gray = Universal (Fuels, Oils
    and Chemicals such as antifreeze)**
-   Divert spill away from ditches and watercourses.
-   Once the spill is contained, attempt to soak it up using an
    absorbent pads.
-   Place the absorbent pads and any contaminated soil in a container
    and dispose of it in accordance with the MSDS sheet and provincial
    regulations.

**Step 3. Reporting Requirements**

-   All spills must be reported to the Site Supervisor and the EM. If
    the EM cannot be reached, notify the Provincial Emergency Program
    (PEP) at 1-800-663-3456 if the spill meets the thresholds detailed
    in the Spill Reporting Regulation of BC. A summary of the reporting
    thresholds for the most likely spilled materials is below.

**Spill Reporting Thresholds** Oil Fuel, Oil & Hydraulic fluid: Any
    quantity that enters or is likely to enter water \>100L to land
    Antifreeze: Any quantity that enters or is likely to enter water
    \>25L to land

### Injury

**Minor wounds, breaks, strains:**

-   Ensure site is safe, stabilize patient (provide first-aid),
    transport to closest Hospital, if necessary.

-   Advise office and hospital when you are on route

-   If accident is the result of a motor vehicle accident, please advise
    the RCMP at 250 353 2225

**Serious injury:**

-   Ensure site is safe, then stabilize (provide first-aid) and/or
    prepare patient for transport.

-   Activate SPOT messenger, or call 1 800 461 9911 (if using the
    satellite phone).

-   Provide nature of injuries, location co-ordinates in UTM or
    longitude and latitude for landing site, and communication method to
    use on the way to the accident site.

-   If air evacuation is required, you must advise the communication
    centre you've reached; if road evacuation is used, then advise if
    you will be meeting the ambulance en route.

### Fatality

-   Ensure site is safe
-   Activate SPOT messenger, or call 1 800 461 9911 (if using the
    satellite phone)
-   Contact Nelson WCB at 1 800 663 4962
-   Do not disturb the site, cover the body, ribbon off the area, and
    block access if possible


## Site and Worker Assessments

Conducting a systematic risk assessment will help identify the hazards that exist in the workplace, and how they may
put workers at risk. To determine if we've done enough to protect
our workers, we use a rating system as part of our risk assessment. Risk is calculated by multiplying the likelihood by the severity.

Examples of risks/hazards found in and around job sites include, but are not limited to:

* Wildlife
* Swiftwater
* Vehicle traffic
* Slippery/uneven ground
* Exposure to heat or cold
* Machinery
* ATV (roll over, burns, collision)
* Chemicals
* Chainsaw/loppers/knives
* Electrofisher shocks
* Open water
* Overhead snags and sharp branches

## Contractor Selection Policy

At New Graph we are responsible to ensure that the contractors we hire
to complete and assist on projects are compliant with the workers
compensation act and have a record that illustrates they have a culture
of safety. For forestry related work, contractors are required to be part of Safe
Certified companies. We have a checklist that we require our contractors
to complete to ensure that they meet our requirements. Our policy is to
always get a clearance letter before and after we receive services from
a contractor to confirm whether they registered with worksafe BC and are
paying premiums. The contractor selection and safety checklist forms are
included as [Appendix 4](#contractor).

Of note, contractors are considered our workers if they do not operate
as an independent business and are either not eligible for WorkSafeBC
coverage or decline to purchase WorkSafeBC's optional coverage. Below
are examples of situations where a contractor would likely be our
worker:

-   The contractor supplies only labour

-   The contractor supplies labour and minor materials

-   The contractor supplies labour and a piece of major equipment but is
    not registered with WorkSafeBC

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy

All employees will be provided the required PPE when they are hired, and
instructed on its proper use and care. Employees are responsible for
keeping PPE in good working condition and notifying their supervisor if
any PPE no longer meets safe standards.

All PPE must meet regulatory and Canadian Standards Association
standards.

The following provides a *guideline* to the requirements and use of PPE.
A full listing of requirements can be found in the Occupational Health
and Safety Regulation at
<https://www.worksafebc.com/en/law-policy/occupational-health-safety/searchable-ohs-regulation/ohs-regulation/part-08-personal-protective-clothing-and-equipment>
