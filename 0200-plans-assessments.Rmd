# Plans and Assessments

## Field Safety Plans {#field-safety-plans .Style1} 
 
### Check-in Procedures and Field Communications

Check in procedures are set up so that someone is watching our back in the field. Call, text or in reach emergency contact to keep them updated on your plan ([emergency contact list](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/onboarding/blob/main/data/template_contacts_safetylog.csv)). This information is kept in Field Safety Plans and there are set procedures about what the check in person is to do if they don't get confirmation that the field crews are home safe.  
 
## Hazard / close-call / incident reporting requirements and procedures {#hazard-close-call-incident-reporting-requirements-and-procedures .Style1} 

Close calls are opportunities to prevent incidents in the future.  For this reason we have policies in place that we document them and review them. Close-call reporting templates are provided as an appendix and are required when:

    * there is a near miss for an injury
    * equipment is almost damaged
    
 
## Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and Procedures {#emergency-response-plan-erp-and-procedures .Style1} 
**Remote Site Emergency Call-In Procedures**: 
*	Dial RCMP
*	Name:
*	Location: (GPS, UTM Co-ordinates, Road Km)
*	Phone #
*	Nature Of Injury: (severity, what happened, and # of Victims)
*	Environmental Conditions: (weather, slope, access conditions)
*	Request what you are going to need: (SAR, PEP, Helicopter,)

### Procedures for: FIRE RESPONSE


*	Regularly monitor the fire weather index using representative weather station and determine the appropriate Fire Danger Class for the area. For Danger Class Reports go to: http://bcwildfire.ca/Weather/Maps/danger_rating.html
*	Stop operations and notify he manager and crew immediately upon observation of a fire.
*	Manager should either act as the emergency response team leader or designate another crew member to assume the emergency response team leader role.
*	Call Forest Fire Reporting :  1-800-663-5555 or * 5555 on the Cantel and Telus networks
*	The individual reporting the fire shall remain available to communicate details of the fire suppression activity taken and what may be required.
*	The remaining crew shall begin immediate action on the fire to their level of safety and competence provided it is determined by the emergency response team leader that the fire can be safely controlled by the crew.
*	The person in charge of the crew during suppression operations will continue to supervise the efforts until relieved by licensee/contractor representative or BC Wildfire Management Branch personnel.


### Procedures for: LANDSLIDE, AVALANCHE AND NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE

*	Ensure all workers understand and trained in response procedures and this emergency response plan  is available on site at all times.
*	Notify supervisor and other workers.  If safe to do so, assess situation to determine if activities must be shutdown.
*	Take steps to control further environmental impacts.
*	Supervisors must account for all workers before leaving the site. If a shutdown is required, park all equipment in an environmentally safe location (avoid riparian management areas, steep side slopes, steep road sections, areas with excessive soil moisture, and areas within reach of standing timber).
*	Contact appropriate parties if significant environmental damage or damage to infrastructure requiring repair has occurred (MFLNRO, BCTS, MoTI, etc.).

### Procedures for: SPILL RESPONSE

1. **Step 1. Ensure Safety**
* Assess site hazards to ensure safe work procedures.
*	Notify Site Supervisor and Environmental Monitor (EM).
*	If unsure of the product, consult the MSDS sheets.
*	Eliminate ignition sources if spilled material is flammable.
*	Wear proper personal protective equipment (gloves) contained in the spill kit.
2. **Step 2. Contain the spill**
*	Eliminate the source of the spill.
*	Use contents of the provided spill kit(s) to stop the spread of the spill/leak.  Absorbent socks can be used to surround the spill. 
+	**Remember: White = Fuels & Oils Only,  Gray = Universal (Fuels, Oils and Chemicals such as antifreeze)**
*	Divert spill away from ditches and watercourses.
*	Once the spill is contained, attempt to soak it up using an absorbent pads. 
*	Place the absorbent pads and any contaminated soil in a container and dispose of it in accordance with the MSDS sheet and provincial regulations.
3. **Step 3. Reporting Requirements**
* All spills must be reported to the Site Supervisor and the EM. If the EM cannot be reached, notify the Provincial Emergency Program (PEP) at 1-800-663-3456 if the spill meets the thresholds detailed in the Spill Reporting Regulation of BC.  A summary of the reporting thresholds for the most likely spilled materials is below.

* **Spill Reporting Thresholds** 
Oil Fuel, Oil & Hydraulic fluid:	Any quantity that enters or is likely to enter water
>100L to land
Antifreeze: 	Any quantity that enters or is likely to enter water 
>25L to land


### First Aid Procedures for: INJURY
**Minor wounds, breaks, strains:**
*	Ensure site is safe, stabilize patient (provide first-aid), transport to closest Hospital, if necessary.  
*	Advise office and hospital when you are on route
*	If accident is the result of a motor vehicle accident, please advise the RCMP at 250 353 2225

**Serious injury:**
*	Ensure site is safe, then stabilize (provide first-aid) and/or prepare patient for transport.
*	Activate SPOT messenger, or call 1 800 461 9911 (if using the satellite phone). 
* Provide nature of injuries, location co-ordinates in UTM or longitude and latitude for landing site, and communication method to use on the way to the accident site.  
* If air evacuation is required, you must advise the communication centre youâ€™ve reached; if road evacuation is used, then advise if you will be meeting the ambulance en route.

### Procedures for: FATALITY
*	Ensure site is safe
*	Activate SPOT messenger, or call 1 800 461 9911 (if using the satellite phone)
*	Contact Nelson WCB at 1 800 663 4962

###  Vehicle and Machinery Inspections  

If your wheel falls off your truck you can get hurt or hurt someone else. 
This is an example of why we inspect our equipment, record issues and act to ensure everything is in working order. Included in our tailboard template.
 
##  Site and Worker Assessments  

As an employer, we should conduct a systematic risk assessment to help us identify the hazards that exist in your workplace, and how they may put your workers at risk. To determine if we've done enough to protect our workers, we use a rating system as part of your risk assessment.

##  Contractor Selection Policy 
 
At New Graph we are responsible to ensure that the contractors we hire 
to complete and assist on projects are compliant with the workers 
compensation act and have a record that illustrates they have a culture 
of safety. For forestry related work that contractors need to be Safe 
Certified companies. We have a checklist that we require our contractors 
to complete to ensure that they meet our requirements. Our policy is to 
always get a clearance letter before and after we receive services from 
a contractor to confirm whether they registered with worksafe BC and 
paying premiums. The contractor selection and safety checklist is 
included as Appendix XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
Of note, contractors are considered our workers if they do not operate 
as an independent business and are either not eligible for WorkSafeBC 
coverage or decline to purchase WorkSafeBC's optional coverage. Below 
are examples of situations where a contractor would likely be our 
worker: 
 
-   The contractor supplies only labour 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and minor materials 
 
-   The contractor supplies labour and a piece of major equipment but is 
    not registered with WorkSafeBC 
 
## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) policy 
 
All employees will be provided the required PPE when they are hired, and 
instructed on its proper use and care. Employees are responsible for 
keeping PPE in good working condition and notifying their supervisor if 
any PPE no longer meets safe standards. 
 
All PPE must meet regulatory and Canadian Standards Association 
standards. 
 
The following provides a *guideline* to the requirements and use of PPE. 
A full listing of requirements can be found in the Occupational Health 
and Safety Regulation at
